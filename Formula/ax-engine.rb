    # Keep mlx.metallib beside libmlx.dylib: MLX resolves its precompiled
    # kernels relative to the loaded dylib. Release binaries also carry
    # @loader_path/../libexec so this private Homebrew runtime remains
    # relocatable without editing or invalidating Developer ID signatures.
    # libexec also avoids colliding with a separately installed mlx formula.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      ax-engine binaries for this release are Developer ID signed and notarized
      by Apple. The formula installs the release's pinned, prebuilt MLX runtime
      beside its mlx.metallib without rewriting the signed Mach-O files.
      Native inference from a ready local model directory needs no Python,
      Homebrew MLX, Xcode, or Metal Toolchain. Model aliases and preparation
      helpers use Python 3.12+; online downloads also require huggingface-hub.
      Set AX_ENGINE_PYTHON to the helper environment's Python interpreter.
